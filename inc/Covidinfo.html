<strong>Single cell analysis to elucidate gene expression profile of ACE2 & TMPRSS2 </strong>

<li>Studies on host-pathogen interaction have identified human ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) as a host cell receptor responsible for mediating infection by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).</li>
<li>Viral spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the ACE2 receptor to initiate viral RNA replication inside the host body.
</li>

<li>TMPRSS2 gene codes a protease Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) which cleaves the viral spike protein and thus helps in viral entry inside the host. This is known as S protein priming.
</li>
<li>By examining the expression patterns of these two genes we can elucidate the viral response pattern on certain human tissues and organs.
